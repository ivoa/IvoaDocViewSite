IVOA Documents View Site
=========================

This project is aiming to create a more modern and integrated
view on the IVOA standard documents. It aims to do this by 
transforming the source of the documents using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) 
and then putting them into a structure delivered using 
[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/). 

It is specifically not intended
to change or replace the standard IVOA document publishing system. Although
perhaps a long term aim, if successful, might be to influence style of the 
content of the standards documents - however, there will always be a conflict
between the designed for academic paper delivery style and a more on-line 
documentation approach.

Site layout
-----------

The original source documents are in [src](./src) as
git submodule references to the original GitHub projects in the
[ivoa-std organisation](https://github.com/ivoa-std). These documents are transformed
into the [sphinxSource/idoc](./sphinxSource/idoc) directory tree. The other content under
[sphinxSource](./sphinxSource) forms the "framework" site in which the autogenerated 
documentation sits.
